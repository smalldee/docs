Interacting with ZetaChain universal apps from the Sui blockchain includes the
This tutorial demonstrates how to withdraw tokens to Sui while calling a Sui
contract in the same transaction—enabling seamless cross-chain operations and
powerful DeFi flows.

You’ll learn how to:

- Set up a localnet environment with ZetaChain and Sui
- Deploy and configure a Sui contract that responds to ZetaChain calls
- Execute withdrawAndCall() to send tokens and trigger contract logic on Sui

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed and configured the following tools before starting:

- [Sui CLI](https://docs.sui.io/references/cli): Required for starting a local
  Sui node and interacting with it.
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/): Needed for encoding payload data using ABI.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Required for parsing JSON output from
  Sui CLI.

## Contract Overview

The example contract demonstrates how to handle cross-chain interactions between
ZetaChain and Sui. The contract implements a `connected` module that:

- Receives tokens from ZetaChain through the `on_call` function
- Performs a token swap using a mock Cetus DEX implementation
- Transfers the swapped tokens to a specified receiver address

The Sui contract uses `0x2::coin` and a custom `token::TOKEN` type to represent
the transferred asset.

## Clone the Example Project

Begin by cloning the example contracts repository and installing its
dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeta-chain/example-contracts
cd example-contracts/examples/call
yarn
```

## Launch Localnet

Start your local development environment, which sets up instances of ZetaChain
and Sui:

```bash
npx hardhat localnet
```

Keep this terminal window open. You should see a table displaying the deployment
details, including Gateway module and object IDs.

## Deploy a Contract on Sui

Navigate to the Sui contract directory and deploy the contract:

```bash
cd sui
```

```
sui move build --force
```

```
PUBLISHED=$(sui client publish --skip-dependency-verification --json)
```

```
PACKAGE=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "published") | .packageId')
```

This will deploy the contract and store the package ID in the `$PACKAGE`
variable.

## Set Up the Pool

After deployment, you'll need to set up the pool by minting tokens and creating
the initial liquidity.

Get the treasury cap:

```bash
TREASURY=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "0x2::coin::TreasuryCap<\($pkg)::token::TOKEN>") | .objectId')
```

Get the pool ID:

```
POOL=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::Pool<0x2::sui::SUI, \($pkg)::token::TOKEN>") | .objectId')
```

Mint tokens to your address:

```
RECIPIENT=$(sui client active-address)
sui client call \
  --package "$PACKAGE" \
  --module token \
  --function mint \
  --args "$TREASURY" 1000000 "$RECIPIENT"
```

Get the token ID:

```
TOKEN=$(sui client objects --json | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.[].data | select(.type == "0x2::coin::Coin<\($pkg)::token::TOKEN>") | .objectId')
```

Deposit tokens into the pool:

```
sui client call \
  --package "$PACKAGE" \
  --module cetusmock \
  --function deposit \
  --type-args "0x2::sui::SUI" "$PACKAGE::token::TOKEN" \
  --args "$POOL" "$TOKEN"
```

## Execute Withdraw and Call

Now you can execute the withdraw and call operation. This will withdraw tokens
from ZetaChain to Sui and simultaneously call a contract on Sui.

Get the required contract IDs:

```bash
CONFIG=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::GlobalConfig") | .objectId')
```

```
CLOCK=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::Clock") | .objectId')
```

```
PARTNER=$(echo $PUBLISHED | jq -r --arg pkg "$PACKAGE" '.objectChanges[] | select(.type == "created" and .objectType == "\($pkg)::cetusmock::Partner") | .objectId')
```

Prepare the payload:

```
MESSAGE=$RECIPIENT
```

```
TOKEN_TYPE="$PACKAGE::token::TOKEN"
```

```
PAYLOAD=$(npx ts-node ./setup/encodeCallArgs.ts "$TOKEN_TYPE" "$CONFIG,$POOL,$PARTNER,$CLOCK" "$MESSAGE")
```

# Execute the withdraw and call

```
cast send 0x5FC8d32690cc91D4c39d9d3abcBD16989F875707 "withdrawAndCall(bytes,uint256,address,bytes,(uint256,bool),(address,bool,address,bytes,uint256))" \
  "$PACKAGE" \
  "1000000" \
  "0xd97B1de3619ed2c6BEb3860147E30cA8A7dC9891" \
  "$PAYLOAD" \
  "(10000,false)" \
  "(0xB0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48,true,0xC0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB49,0xdeadbeef,50000)" \
  --private-key ac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

This transaction will:

1. Withdraw tokens from ZetaChain to Sui
2. Call a Sui contract with the specified parameters

The operation demonstrates how to perform complex cross-chain operations that
combine asset withdrawals with contract calls, enabling sophisticated DeFi
interactions between ZetaChain and Sui.
